abstract = {This paper extends the Dijkstra monad framework, designed for writing specifications over effectful programs using monadic effects, to handle termination sensitive specifications over interactive programs. We achieve this by introducing base specification monads for non-terminating programs with uninterpreted events. We model such programs using interaction trees, a coinductive datatype for representing programs with algebraic effects in Coq, which we further develop by adding trace semantics. We show that this approach subsumes typical, simple proof principles. The framework is implemented as an extension of the Interaction Trees Coq library.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a specification framework for monadic, recursive, interactive programs that supports auto-active verification, an approach that combines user-provided guidance with automatic verification techniques. This verification tool is designed to have the flexibility of a manual approach to verification along with the usability benefits of automatic approaches. We accomplish this by augmenting Interaction Trees, a Coq datastructure for representing effectful computations, with logical quantifier events. We show that this yields a language of specifications that are easy to understand, automatable, and are powerful enough to handle properties that involve non-termination. Our framework is implemented as a library in Coq. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by verifying real, low-level code. }

  abstract = {Noninterference is the strong information-security property that a program does not leak secrets through publicly-visible behavior. In the presence of effects such as nontermination, state, and exceptions, reasoning about noninterference quickly becomes subtle. We advocate using interaction trees (ITrees) to provide compositional mechanized proofs of noninterference for multi-language, effectful, nonterminating programs, while retaining executability of the semantics. We develop important foundations for security analysis with ITrees: two indistinguishability relations, leading to two standard notions of noninterference with adversaries of different strength, along with metatheory libraries for reasoning about each. We demonstrate the utility of our results using a simple imperative language with embedded assembly, along with a compiler into that assembly language.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
